# Child Nutrition Calculator

**Welcome to Child Nutrition Calculator!**

The Child Nutrition Calculator is a Python program designed to empower parents and caregivers with insights into the nutritional well-being of children. By utilizing this calculator, you can easily assess a child's nutritional status, monitor their Body Mass Index (BMI), and track daily calorie intake based on age, weight, height, and food consumption.

## Features

- **BMI Assessment:** Calculate the child's Body Mass Index to gauge their health classification, including underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese.

- **Nutritional Insights:** Estimate the child's recommended daily calorie intake according to their specific age group, allowing for personalized nutritional guidance.

- **Food Caloric Tracking:** Effortlessly keep track of the child's calorie consumption by inputting quantities of various food items, each associated with specific caloric values.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the child's consumed calories against the recommended values, providing valuable feedback on their nutritional habits.

This intuitive tool promotes awareness and understanding of a child's nutrition, enabling caregivers to make informed decisions and collaborate with healthcare professionals to ensure the child's healthy growth and development.
